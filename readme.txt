= What do I need to run this plugin?

You need to signup in http://www.thumbr.io/signup and enable uploads in
your storage backend settings in http://www.thumbr.io/profile/storage.
This plugin only works with the Thumbr.io and the Amazon S3 backend.
It does NOT yet work if you use a Dropbox backend.

Once you have set the storage backend, you have to go to Settings->Thumbr.io
and copy there your Thumbr.io API_KEY and SECRET_KEY (from
http://www.thumbr.io/profile).
